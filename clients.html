          <div class="title big">FOR MNOs</div>
<p>One of the greatest challenges facing Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) is how to deliver the best possible mobile experience to subscribers.  At any given moment, 
      a user might have access both to cellular networks and Wi-Fi hotspots.</p>
      <p>And thus, at any given moment, you must decide which data delivery system will result in the highest subscriber satisfaction.</p>
      <p>In the absence of detailed analytics (i.e. mobile devices, buffering speeds, locations), making this decision involves a great deal of guesswork – guesswork that often burdens the network and results in a sub-optimal experience for subscribers.</p>
      <p>But what if you could tap into a growing database of actionable 
      analytics built around:</p>
    <ul class="blue">
      <li>User locations</li>
      <li>User devices</li>
      <li>Mobile applications</li>
      <li>Network quality</li>
      <li>Public Wi-Fi access</li>
      <li>Speed (through-put)</li>
    </ul>
           <p>With these real-time data at your fingertips, you would be able to seamlessly transition subscribers to whatever available networks (Wi-Fi or cellular) deliver the best results at that exact moment in time.</p> 
    <p>At wefi, we specialize in Intelligent Network Selection, allowing you to deliver optimal results with minimal guesswork.  This means fewer costs to you (the MNO), faster load times for end-users, and less congestion across your network.</p>

          <div class="title big">FOR MSOs</div>
          <div class="title small">At wefi, we offer a more streamlined approach built around both historic and real-time analytics that include: </div>
          <ul class="green">
    <li>Public Wi-Fi access</li>
    <li>Speed (through-put)</li>
    <li>User locations</li>
    <li>Mobile devices</li>
    <li>Network quality</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As a MultiScreen Operator (MSO), you want to provide the widest possible coverage using the fewest possible resources.  Accomplishing this requires intelligently deploying new Wi-Fi hotspots in high traffic areas – areas where your subscribers congregate in the largest numbers.</p>
      <p>But how exactly do you determine where to erect new Wi-Fi hotspots?</p>
      <p>Traditional methods involved looking at historic user data and making educated guesses about where to divert limited resources.</p>
 <p>With this real-time Intelligent Network Selection, you’re able to deliver a superior user experience for paying subscribers, thus, boosting your retention numbers.  Equally important, these real-time data enable you to more effectively deploy limited resources for optimal impact – an approach that reduces operational costs and network loads.</p>

          <div class="title big">FOR CONTENT PROVIDERS</div>
          <p>As a content provider, you build your subscriber base by offering the highest quality, on-demand media possible – regardless of when or where a user logs on.</p>
          <div class="title small">However, you don’t always have real-time access to user analytics such as:</div>
          <ul class="orange">
      <li>Network loads</li>
      <li>Mobile devices</li>
      <li>User locations</li>
      <li>Wi-Fi availability</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Consequently, content delivery requires a great deal of guesswork.  And this often results in a poor user experience (for the subscriber) and higher costs (for the content provider):</p>   
         <ul class="orange">
      <li>If the bitrate is too low, you make suboptimal use of available bandwidth</li>
      <li>If the bitrate is too high, users experience unnecessary buffering</li>
          </ul>
<p>And thus, many content providers simultaneously send out multiple versions of the same content.  This solution covers all the bases, but it also represents the worst of both worlds.  Users receive low quality content AND unnecessary wait-times. </p><br></br>
          <div class="title middle">WEFI'S PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS</div>  
          <p>
      At wefi, we analyze data across numerous cellular networks and hundreds of millions of Wi-Fi hotspots to provide you with real-time and predictive insights into user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these detailed analytics, you know (in advance) the highest possible bitrate that every subscriber in your network can receive – prior to content delivery.  And throughout each visitor’s session, our real-time data allow you to adjust the bitrate of that content – even if a subscriber changes locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, we don’t simply analyze user behavior.  We also evaluate the quality of all available cellular and Wi-Fi networks.  This real-time analysis allows you to adjust the bitrate of your content as subscribers change networks mid-delivery stream.
    </p>
    <p>      
      By leveraging wefi’s predictive analytics and intelligent user offloading, you’re able to offer subscribers the highest acceptable bitrate at the lowest possible cost.  The end result is a better user experience for all subscribers, regardless of time, location, or network access.
